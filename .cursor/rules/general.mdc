## Performance

Optimize bundle size, implement proper image optimization, use Next.js built-in performance features, and monitor Core Web Vitals.

## Deployment

Use proper environment variables, implement proper build optimization, use Next.js static generation when possible, and implement proper error monitoring.

## Documentation

Use JSDoc for complex functions, document component props, explain business logic, and keep comments up to date.

## Security

Validate all user inputs, use proper authentication, implement proper authorization, and sanitize data before rendering.

## Version Control

Use feature branches, write descriptive commit messages, use proper PR templates, and implement proper code review.

## Best Practices

Follow Clean Code principles, use SOLID principles, implement proper design patterns, and maintain consistent code style.
